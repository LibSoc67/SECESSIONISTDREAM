# Logic for Democratic AI on how to deal in peace conferences
# Should favor liberating Democratic countries and forcing government upon other states
# Written by Henrik "Groogy" Hansson

#Adjustments
#The generic democratic AI will generally prefer liberation and will mostly seek to install government. 
#Major democratic nations and minors with overseas colonies can take colonies in peace deals and will prefer to do so after taking cores.
#Democracies will never annex.
