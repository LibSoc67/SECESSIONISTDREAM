 CAV_1936_DESC:0 "Castilla La Vieja was one of the last remaining countries to leave the spanish union. Now the Falange Castellana rules the young country, with Redondo as the supreme leader. He is known for his imperialist ideas, and he claims he will turn Castilla La Vieja into a global superpower. Will he be up to the expectatives?"
 Iberia_NAME:0 "Iberia In Fire
 Iberia_DESC:0 "Spain has colapsed and now every region from the former country is independent. Castilla La Vieja is now ruled by a fascist nationalist goverment, with very threatening imperialist ideas. Catalonia is a political melting pot, but for now a communist goverment rule supreme. Galicia is a beacon for democracy, but the republic is filled with inestability. In the south, Andalucia is on the verge of a civil war, and a miracle should happen to avoid such destiny. Who will come on top?"
 CAT_1936_DESC:0 "Catalonia was one of the very first nations to become independent, and in a way, the main cause to make Spain colapse. Nowadays people from all around Europe are coming to this country to experience the economical miracle that is taking place in here, encouraged by the loose immigration laws. The Partit Obrer Unificat Marxista or POUM has taken power, but their position is beeing threatened by many, specialy nationalists and totalists."
 mnc_book_DESC:0 "In 1911 the Monégasque constitution was written, effectively turning Monaco into a constitutional principality. But if the prince is loved enough he might be able to reestablish an absolut principality again. On the other hand, if the prince is hated enough, a republic might be established."
 CEN_1936_DESC:0 "Centre has the ardous task of uniting all the French speaking lands onto one banner. In 1931, the Glorieuse Révolution was carried out, and a National Socialist goverment was established. The Cercle Proudhon, the Moviment de Salut National and the Nationaux-Marxistes were pivotal points in the revolution. However, these three factions have very distinct visions of fascism, and the relatively new goverment has to decide with whom does he side with, and whom does he destroy."
