 ultimatumtorioja.1.d:0 "Yesterday troops from the Castilla Empire were placed all over our border, claiming that they would enter the country if we refused to be integrated into the Castillean goverment. It seems like we have no choice but surrendering without fighting. The Galician goverment and the Aragonese have both condemned the act, but it seems unlikely that they will do something to help us."
iberianews.1.d:0 "For a few months tensions between the catalan and the spanish population living inside of Catalonia has been on the rise. However, yesterday it reached a new peak when the catalan goverment pardoned two murderers who killed various spanish people. This has lead to open battle between both ethnicities, and now the catalans are trying to genocide all the spanish population, with the goverment turning a blind eye. The spanish population in Catalonia is begging to both of the Castillan goverments for help, and it's very likely that they will intervene militarily, although their official response is still unknown."
iberianews.2.d:0 "Today the catalan goverment has oficialy stated that they would make the dream of the Catalan Countries come true. They wish to reunite all the regions that speak Catalan under a single banner, because they consider language to be the maximum exponent of culture, and so every catalan speaking region has the Catalan culture. They have also said that they would do anything necessary to make it come true, even if that means war. "
iberianews.3.d:0 "Today the Occitan province of Carcassone has carried out a socialist and pro Catalan revolt. The province has unilateraly declared themselves independent, although efectively they were nothing more than a Catalan puppet. Then they declared themselves to be the rightfull goverment of all the Occitans.

First the province of Carcassone revolted, and unilateraly declared themselves independent, although efectively they were nothing more than a Catalan puppet. Then they declared themselves to be the rightfull goverment of all the Occitans. The original democratic Occitan goverment was forced to be integrated into the new Catalano-Occitan communion due to the catalan pressure."
iberianews.5.d:0 "Today a group of pro-Spanish rebels have taken control over Barcelona. Those rebels were supported by Old Castilla.

iberianews.6.d:0 "Today a group of pro-Spanish rebels have attempted to take control over Barcelona, but they failed.

iberianews.13.d:0 "After months of intense protesting from the general population, as well as the army, the Occitanian Republican Goverment has resigned in favor of Ramau Durand, the leader of the Languedocian Military Authority.

ulttoval.2.d:0 "Due to our recent threat to Valencias independence, a valencian spanish speaking exclave called "el Racó d'Ademús" has declared independence. It is totally surrounded by Castilla-La Mancha, so unless they allow us to march our troops, we won't be able to reincorporate the revelious province."

cat_dem.1.d:0 "Following Troskyst principles, in Catalonia there aren't any state elections, but there are regional ones. In this elections the local Buró is elected. Only left-winged candidates are allowed to participate, and normally a communist Buró wins, either because he is genuinely more popular or because corruption and manipulation. But yesterday, in LLeida, the most important Catalan city of the interior, a social-democrat Buró won. LLuís Companys is a very renowned politician, who managed to rally inmense amount of support in all of Catalonia, but specially in the rural areas, more skeptical of communism. The future is unclear, will the communist goverment allow the defeat?"
cat_dem.2.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, the Catalan goverment concedes the defeat of LLeida, and will allow LLuís Companys to rule the place. But Companys will be under the close supervision of the central goverment: Everything he does will need the POUM approval."
cat_dem.3.d:0 "Following LLeidas example, many more cities have voted for a Social-Democrat Buró. Most notably, the city of Vic. The central goverment feels threatened, as they are losing popular support. Many in the goverment are calling for a stop on all municipal elections, and the stablishment of a strict dictatorship, but Nin doesn't feel compelled by this idea."
cat_dem.4.d:0 "Finally, Andreu Nin has stepped down as the head of our State to avoid any possible civil war. He has officialy resigned because he understands the massive shift in the popular opinion: A few years ago, the people were begging for socialism, now a majority of people dislike it. The Communist regime looks like is going to peacefully give up on their grip over Catalonia. Some die-hard supporters of communism are still trying to desperately hold onto however power they still have, but it feels futile: The popular opinion has abandoned socialism."
cat_dem.5.d:0 "National Elections are once again here. Despite cooperating in the peacful revolution, all the parties are once again rivals. The most probable winner of the elections is the ERC, a social-democrat coalition. Alternatively, the people might be tiered of left-wings in general, and so the less popular but more conservative LLiga Catalana could surprise and win. The outcome of the elections was:"

You decide to open the letter. It says that you are invited to a top level meeting with the Catars leaders, and it gives you a place and a hour. Now you have two options. Either send the police to arrest them, or attend to the meeting."

Down there there are about 10 people, all with masks. They greet you and they start the meeting. The main point of the meeting was to discus whether distributism or oligarchy was better for a post revolution society. Distributism is a religious ideology that interprets the bible with a very similar outcome to communism: a moneyless and classless society. Oligarchy is a form of goverment in wich the people with the most money are the ones that control the goverment. Which position do you defend?"
